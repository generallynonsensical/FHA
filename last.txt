Summary of Today's Work (Tuesday, 10-31-23)

Project Review: Started off by reviewing your Next.js project structure and your detailed app description for a Formal Hazard Assessment Web App.

Component Structuring: Discussed breaking down the app into modular components like accordions for General Info, Task, Hazard, and Control; as well as output tables, and utility buttons. Created these as separate .tsx files.

TypeScript Adoption: Worked on adopting TypeScript, clarified filename conventions (*.tsx for React components), and settled on TypeScript for your Next.js project.

File Structure Fixes: Addressed issues related to project structure, especially with Next.js convention for the pages directory and TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json).

Styling Setup: Sorted out issues related to global CSS and set up the foundational styles for your app, focusing on accessibility, professionalism, and modern design.

Tailwind CSS: Laid the groundwork for utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling, although we haven't applied it to individual components yet.

You've mentioned that you learn best through actual visualization and repetition, so we've been focused on providing complete code examples for you to work with. We've also covered some accessibility considerations in anticipation of styling the components.

Summary of Today's Work

    Project Structure: We reviewed the initial project structure and made improvements for better manageability.
    Component Breakdown: Divided the app into different functional components like accordions and tables.
    TypeScript & File Extensions: Clarified the use of .tsx and .ts extensions for different types of files.
    Styling with Tailwind: Introduced Tailwind CSS for styling the application components.
    Detailed Components: Worked on the General Info Accordion, Task Accordion, Hazard Accordion, Control Accordion, Undo-Redo Buttons, Evaluation Table, and PDF Generator components.
    Containers: Created AccordionContainer and TableContainer for better modularization.

Summary of Today's Work (Thursday, 11-16-23)

DataController

    State Management for Accordions: Added state variables (isTaskAccordionExpanded, isHazardAccordionExpanded, isControlAccordionExpanded) to manage the expanded/collapsed states of different accordion modules.
    Toggle Functions: Implemented toggle functions (toggleTaskAccordion, toggleHazardAccordion, toggleControlAccordion) for each accordion module to change their expanded states.
    Generic Submit Handler: Included a generic handleSubmit function that can be used to handle data submissions from the accordion modules.
    Data Fetching: Added a fetchData function and called it within a useEffect hook to fetch data when the component mounts.
    Props Passing: Passed down the expanded state and toggle functions as props to each accordion module (TaskModule, HazardModule, ControlModule).

AccordionModule

    Form Wrapping: Modified the component to wrap the children and the Button inside a form element. This change aligns the component with standard HTML form handling.
    Button Type as Submit: Changed the button's type to submit, allowing the button to trigger the form's onSubmit event.
    Prop Type Adjustment: Ensured the onSubmit prop type is correctly set to handle a form submission event (event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => void.

TaskModule

    Removed Local Expanded State Management: Eliminated the local state management for the expanded state, as it's now being controlled by DataController.
    Using Props for State and Actions: Updated the component to use the expanded state and onToggle function passed as props from DataController.
    Internal Form Submission Logic: Retained the form submission logic (performFormSubmission) within TaskModule, specific to task-related data handling and validation.

These changes collectively enhance the structure and functionality of your application:

    DataController now acts as a centralized manager for the accordion states, making state management more consistent across different modules.
    AccordionModule is modified for better form handling, aligning with standard practices in React and HTML.
    TaskModule has become more focused on its specific functionality (handling task-related data) while relying on DataController for shared state management.

    Summary of Today's Session:

    Analyzing and Resolving Hydration Errors:
        Examined TaskModule, HazardModule, ControlModule, and AccordionModule for hydration error causes.
        Suggested and verified the removal of nested form tags, which resolved the hydration errors.

    Accordion Behavior in SPA:
        Analyzed the DataController, TaskModule, HazardModule, and ControlModule to ensure correct accordion functionality.
        Recommended ensuring uniform handleSubmit functions across modules and alignment with DataController.

    Styling Issues with Accordions:
        Reviewed TaskModule, HazardModule, ControlModule, and AccordionModule for potential styling conflicts.
        Discussed proper implementation and use of expanded and onToggle props.

    Aligning InputModule and OutputModule:
        Examined index.tsx and suggested using Flexbox for aligning InputModule and OutputModule on the page.
        The implementation was successful, achieving the desired layout.

Pending Tasks 

    Finalizing Accordion Functionality:
        Ensure that the accordion's open/close functionality is working as intended based on user interactions and form submissions.
        Test the behavior in different scenarios to confirm stability and reliability.

    Completing SPA Functionality:
        Finalize any remaining functionality, such as data fetching, form validations, and handling of user inputs.

    Styling and Responsiveness:
        Refine the styling of individual components and the overall application.
        Ensure the application is responsive and looks good on various screen sizes.

    Testing and Debugging:
        Conduct thorough testing of the application to identify and fix any bugs.
        Perform user experience testing to ensure the application is intuitive and user-friendly.

    Code Optimization and Cleanup:
        Review the codebase for any opportunities to optimize and clean up the code.
        Refactor any redundant or overly complex code sections for better maintainability.

    Database Integration and Backend API Development:
        Set up a backend system for database operations.
        Create API endpoints for submitting data from accordions and retrieving data for the OutputModule.
        Integrate the frontend with these API endpoints for data submission and retrieval.

    Frontend Data Management:
        Implement frontend logic to send data from accordions to the backend and display retrieved data in the OutputModule.
        Consider using state management libraries for efficient data handling across components.

    Error Handling and Data Validation:
        Implement robust error handling and data validation both on the frontend and backend.
