Summary of Today's Work (Tuesday, 10-31-23)

Project Review: Started off by reviewing your Next.js project structure and your detailed app description for a Formal Hazard Assessment Web App.

Component Structuring: Discussed breaking down the app into modular components like accordions for General Info, Task, Hazard, and Control; as well as output tables, and utility buttons. Created these as separate .tsx files.

TypeScript Adoption: Worked on adopting TypeScript, clarified filename conventions (*.tsx for React components), and settled on TypeScript for your Next.js project.

File Structure Fixes: Addressed issues related to project structure, especially with Next.js convention for the pages directory and TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json).

Styling Setup: Sorted out issues related to global CSS and set up the foundational styles for your app, focusing on accessibility, professionalism, and modern design.

Tailwind CSS: Laid the groundwork for utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling, although we haven't applied it to individual components yet.

You've mentioned that you learn best through actual visualization and repetition, so we've been focused on providing complete code examples for you to work with. We've also covered some accessibility considerations in anticipation of styling the components.

Summary of Today's Work

    Project Structure: We reviewed the initial project structure and made improvements for better manageability.
    Component Breakdown: Divided the app into different functional components like accordions and tables.
    TypeScript & File Extensions: Clarified the use of .tsx and .ts extensions for different types of files.
    Styling with Tailwind: Introduced Tailwind CSS for styling the application components.
    Detailed Components: Worked on the General Info Accordion, Task Accordion, Hazard Accordion, Control Accordion, Undo-Redo Buttons, Evaluation Table, and PDF Generator components.
    Containers: Created AccordionContainer and TableContainer for better modularization.

Summary of Today's Work (Thursday, 11-16-23)

DataController

    State Management for Accordions: Added state variables (isTaskAccordionExpanded, isHazardAccordionExpanded, isControlAccordionExpanded) to manage the expanded/collapsed states of different accordion modules.
    Toggle Functions: Implemented toggle functions (toggleTaskAccordion, toggleHazardAccordion, toggleControlAccordion) for each accordion module to change their expanded states.
    Generic Submit Handler: Included a generic handleSubmit function that can be used to handle data submissions from the accordion modules.
    Data Fetching: Added a fetchData function and called it within a useEffect hook to fetch data when the component mounts.
    Props Passing: Passed down the expanded state and toggle functions as props to each accordion module (TaskModule, HazardModule, ControlModule).

AccordionModule

    Form Wrapping: Modified the component to wrap the children and the Button inside a form element. This change aligns the component with standard HTML form handling.
    Button Type as Submit: Changed the button's type to submit, allowing the button to trigger the form's onSubmit event.
    Prop Type Adjustment: Ensured the onSubmit prop type is correctly set to handle a form submission event (event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => void.

TaskModule

    Removed Local Expanded State Management: Eliminated the local state management for the expanded state, as it's now being controlled by DataController.
    Using Props for State and Actions: Updated the component to use the expanded state and onToggle function passed as props from DataController.
    Internal Form Submission Logic: Retained the form submission logic (performFormSubmission) within TaskModule, specific to task-related data handling and validation.

These changes collectively enhance the structure and functionality of your application:

    DataController now acts as a centralized manager for the accordion states, making state management more consistent across different modules.
    AccordionModule is modified for better form handling, aligning with standard practices in React and HTML.
    TaskModule has become more focused on its specific functionality (handling task-related data) while relying on DataController for shared state management.
