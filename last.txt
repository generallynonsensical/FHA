Summary of Today's Work (Tuesday, 10-31-23)

Project Review: Started off by reviewing your Next.js project structure and your detailed app description for a Formal Hazard Assessment Web App.

Component Structuring: Discussed breaking down the app into modular components like accordions for General Info, Task, Hazard, and Control; as well as output tables, and utility buttons. Created these as separate .tsx files.

TypeScript Adoption: Worked on adopting TypeScript, clarified filename conventions (*.tsx for React components), and settled on TypeScript for your Next.js project.

File Structure Fixes: Addressed issues related to project structure, especially with Next.js convention for the pages directory and TypeScript configuration (tsconfig.json).

Styling Setup: Sorted out issues related to global CSS and set up the foundational styles for your app, focusing on accessibility, professionalism, and modern design.

Tailwind CSS: Laid the groundwork for utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling, although we haven't applied it to individual components yet.

You've mentioned that you learn best through actual visualization and repetition, so we've been focused on providing complete code examples for you to work with. We've also covered some accessibility considerations in anticipation of styling the components.

Summary of Today's Work (Thursday, 11-16-23)

DataController

    State Management for Accordions: Added state variables (isTaskAccordionExpanded, isHazardAccordionExpanded, isControlAccordionExpanded) to manage the expanded/collapsed states of different accordion modules.
    Toggle Functions: Implemented toggle functions (toggleTaskAccordion, toggleHazardAccordion, toggleControlAccordion) for each accordion module to change their expanded states.
    Generic Submit Handler: Included a generic handleSubmit function that can be used to handle data submissions from the accordion modules.
    Data Fetching: Added a fetchData function and called it within a useEffect hook to fetch data when the component mounts.
    Props Passing: Passed down the expanded state and toggle functions as props to each accordion module (TaskModule, HazardModule, ControlModule).

AccordionModule

    Form Wrapping: Modified the component to wrap the children and the Button inside a form element. This change aligns the component with standard HTML form handling.
    Button Type as Submit: Changed the button's type to submit, allowing the button to trigger the form's onSubmit event.
    Prop Type Adjustment: Ensured the onSubmit prop type is correctly set to handle a form submission event (event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => void.

TaskModule

    Removed Local Expanded State Management: Eliminated the local state management for the expanded state, as it's now being controlled by DataController.
    Using Props for State and Actions: Updated the component to use the expanded state and onToggle function passed as props from DataController.
    Internal Form Submission Logic: Retained the form submission logic (performFormSubmission) within TaskModule, specific to task-related data handling and validation.

These changes collectively enhance the structure and functionality of your application:

    DataController now acts as a centralized manager for the accordion states, making state management more consistent across different modules.
    AccordionModule is modified for better form handling, aligning with standard practices in React and HTML.
    TaskModule has become more focused on its specific functionality (handling task-related data) while relying on DataController for shared state management.

    Analyzing and Resolving Hydration Errors:
        Examined TaskModule, HazardModule, ControlModule, and AccordionModule for hydration error causes.
        Suggested and verified the removal of nested form tags, which resolved the hydration errors.

    Accordion Behavior in SPA:
        Analyzed the DataController, TaskModule, HazardModule, and ControlModule to ensure correct accordion functionality.
        Recommended ensuring uniform handleSubmit functions across modules and alignment with DataController.

    Styling Issues with Accordions:
        Reviewed TaskModule, HazardModule, ControlModule, and AccordionModule for potential styling conflicts.
        Discussed proper implementation and use of expanded and onToggle props.

    Aligning InputModule and OutputModule:
        Examined index.tsx and suggested using Flexbox for aligning InputModule and OutputModule on the page.
        The implementation was successful, achieving the desired layout.

Pending Tasks 

    Finalizing Accordion Functionality:
        Ensure that the accordion's open/close functionality is working as intended based on user interactions and form submissions.
        Test the behavior in different scenarios to confirm stability and reliability.

    Completing SPA Functionality:
        Finalize any remaining functionality, such as data fetching, form validations, and handling of user inputs.

    Styling and Responsiveness:
        Refine the styling of individual components and the overall application.
        Ensure the application is responsive and looks good on various screen sizes.

    Testing and Debugging:
        Conduct thorough testing of the application to identify and fix any bugs.
        Perform user experience testing to ensure the application is intuitive and user-friendly.

    Code Optimization and Cleanup:
        Review the codebase for any opportunities to optimize and clean up the code.
        Refactor any redundant or overly complex code sections for better maintainability.

Summary of Today's Work (Friday, 11-24-23)

Today, we focused on debugging the issue with the accordion functionality in your Single Page Application (SPA). Here's a summary of what we've done and what steps remain:
Accomplished Today:

    Reviewed Project Summary: We discussed the intended behavior for your accordions - on page load, the task accordion should be open while others are closed. As each section is validated and submitted, the next accordion should open sequentially.

    File Analysis:
        You uploaded your updated repository, and I extracted and listed the files, focusing particularly on the src directory.
        We examined the key files in the components directory, especially DataController.tsx, TaskModule.tsx, HazardModule.tsx, and ControlModule.tsx.
        I reviewed the structure and code snippets of these files to understand how they manage the accordion states and interactions.

    Identified Potential Issues:
        The central issue appears to be that all accordions are opening and closing together, instead of individually.
        We discussed possible causes, such as shared state management or incorrect prop handling in the modules.

Next Steps:

    Detailed File Review:
        Perform an in-depth review of the TaskModule.tsx, HazardModule.tsx, and ControlModule.tsx files to understand how they handle the expanded, onToggle, and onSubmit props.
        Verify the integration of these modules with the AccordionModule and how they interact with the DataController.

    Debugging:
        Add more console.log statements in critical areas of the code for better tracking of state changes and function calls.
        Isolate the issue by testing individual modules and their interactions with the DataController.

    Testing and Validation:
        Test the application after making adjustments to ensure that each accordion behaves as expected.
        Validate that the sequential logic of opening and closing accordions is functioning correctly upon form submissions.

    Refinement and Finalization:
        Refine the code based on the findings from debugging and testing.
        Finalize the accordion functionality to match the intended behavior of your SPA.

Summary of Today's Work (Thursday, 11-30-23):

Debugged an issue with the GeneralModule accordion not being expanded on load. Found that the isGeneralAccordionExpanded state variable was correctly initialized and passed as a prop to the InputModule component.

Discussed the App component and its state variables. Noted that the state update functions (setIsGeneralAccordionExpanded, setIsTaskExpanded, setIsHazardExpanded, setIsControlExpanded) were not being used, which meant that the state of the accordions could not be updated after the initial render.

Updated the App component to pass the state update functions as props to the InputModule component.

Updated the InputModule component to accept the state update functions as props and use them to update the state of the accordions.

Encountered a TypeScript error because the InputModuleProps type did not include the state update functions. Updated the InputModuleProps type to fix this.

Encountered another TypeScript error because Dispatch and SetStateAction were not recognized. Fixed this by importing these types from the react module.

Reviewed the AccordionModule component, which is a reusable component for creating accordions.

Next Steps:

Test the InputModule component to ensure that the accordions can be expanded and collapsed as expected.

Create a database for the submitted accordion information

Implement the handleSubmit function in the App component to handle form submission.

Update the AccordionModule component to use the setIsGeneralAccordionExpanded, setIsTaskExpanded, setIsHazardExpanded, and setIsControlExpanded functions to update the state of the accordions when the form is submitted.

Test the AccordionModule component to ensure that the form submission works as expected.
