This directory contains the reusable UI components for your app. It's where you'll find the building blocks for your user interface.

### Specifics for Step 3

1. Open the `components` directory in your editor.
   - Look for existing components that you can use or modify for your app's features.
2. Check for a `source` subdirectory.
   - This might contain the source code for your components. Verify what's in there.
3. Review any `.js`, `.jsx`, `.css`, or `.html` files.
   - These files will contain the actual code for your components. Make sure to understand what each component does.

### Why Step 3?

Components are the reusable pieces of your UI. Understanding what you already have can save you time and effort, and help you plan what new components you might need.

## Step 4: Main Interface

## Actions for Step 4

- Open files in the `pages` directory.

### Description for Step 4

The `pages` directory is where your main interface lives. Each file corresponds to a route in your Next.js app.

### Specifics for Step 4

1. Open the `pages` directory in your editor.
   - Look for TypeScript files (`.ts`) as they define your routes.
2. Check for an `api` subdirectory.
   - This is where your API routes are defined. Make sure to understand what each API route does.
3. Review the code in the TypeScript files.
   - Identify which components from the `components` directory are being used here.
   - Check if there are any API calls or data-fetching methods.

### Why Step 4?

The `pages` directory is crucial for routing and displaying your app's main interface. Understanding how it's set up will help you know where to plug in your components and logic.

## Step 5: Business Logic

## Actions for Step 5

- Go to the `app` directory.

This directory likely contains the layout and global styles for your app. It may also include business logic like data validation or state management.

### Specifics for Step 5

1. Open the `app` directory in your editor.
   - Look for `.css` and `.tsx` files, as these will contain your styles and React components.
2. Review `globals.css`.
   - This file contains global styles that are applied across your app. Check for any classes that are defined here.
3. Open `layout.tsx`.
   - This file likely contains the root layout for your app. Look for the `RootLayout` function and understand how it sets up the layout.
4. Check `page.tsx`.
   - This file might contain a home page or a template for your pages. Look for the `Home` function and see how it's used.

**Why This Step?**

Understanding the layout and global styles will help you maintain consistency across your app. Also, if there's any business logic, knowing where it resides is crucial for feature development.

## Step 6: Styling

## Actions for Step 6

- Check your Tailwind CSS setup.

### Description for Step 6

The `tailwind.config.ts` file is where you configure Tailwind CSS for your project. This file controls how Tailwind generates utility classes, themes, and more.

### Specifics for Step 6

1. Open `tailwind.config.ts` in your editor.
   - This file is crucial for your styling setup.
2. Review the `content` array.
   - This specifies the directories Tailwind should scan for class usage. Make sure it includes all the relevant directories like `pages`, `components`, and `app`.
3. Look at the `theme` object.
   - Check if you have any custom background images or other theme extensions.
4. Check for plugins.
   - The `plugins` array is currently empty, but this is where you'd add any Tailwind plugins if needed.

### Why Step 6?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that can significantly speed up the development process. Understanding how it's configured in your project will help you make the most of it.

## Step 7: Database Logic

## Actions for Step 7
